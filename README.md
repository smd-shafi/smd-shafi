## 👀 **What Keeps Me Awake at Night**  
- 💻 **Full Stack Development** – I make websites behave (even when they don’t want to).  
- ✂️ **Occasionally Editing Videos** – Because making pixels dance is a skill, apparently.
- 🐞 **Debugging Code** – Or as I like to call it, "negotiating with errors."

## 🌱 **Currently Trying to Master**  
- 🌐 **Full Stack Development** – AKA solving problems I created in the first place.

## 💞️ **What I’ll Probably Say Yes To**  
- 🌍 **Web Development Projects** – Need a site that won’t break? Let’s talk.  
- 🎥 **Video Editing Projects** – If your footage isn’t a complete disaster, maybe.
